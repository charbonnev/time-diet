## 📋 Changelog

### Version 1.5.4 (2025-01-14)
**🎯 MAJOR IMPROVEMENT: Smart Debug Test Buttons**

**Test Buttons Now Use REAL Smart-Merge Logic:**
- Debug test buttons now call the actual `scheduleBlockNotifications()` logic!
- Early Warning button correctly shows:
  - "Wrap up: [Current Block]" + "Next: [Next Block]" for contiguous blocks
  - "Coming up: [Block]" for non-contiguous blocks
- Tests the EXACT same code path as production notifications
- Always stays in sync with production behavior

**Technical Implementation:**
- Test function receives full blocks array and settings
- Analyzes block relationships (contiguous vs non-contiguous)
- Generates notifications using Smart-Merge decision tree
- True end-to-end testing of notification system

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Accurate testing of Smart-Merge behavior
- ✅ Catches bugs before they reach production
- ✅ Tests automatically update when logic changes
- ✅ No more confusion about what notifications will look like

**Result:** Debug buttons are now a reliable testing tool!

### Version 1.5.3 (2025-01-14)
**🐛 BUG FIXES: Snooze & UI Cleanup**

**Fixed Snooze from Notifications:**
- Snooze button in notifications now actually snoozes the block!
- Previously only logged the action, now calls `snoozeBlock()` properly
- Loads the correct date schedule before snoozing
- Notifications automatically reschedule after snooze

**UI Cleanup:**
- Removed "Refresh Subscription" button from Settings
- Toggling notifications off/on has the same effect (cleaner UX)
- Updated help text to reflect this
- Removed unused code and imports

**Result:** Notification actions work perfectly end-to-end!

### Version 1.5.2 (2025-01-13)
**✨ UX IMPROVEMENT: Smart Auto-Scroll for Gaps**

**Enhanced Auto-Scroll Logic:**
- **Case 1**: Before first block → Stay at top (no scroll)
- **Case 2**: After last block → Scroll to last block (shows what you just finished)
- **Case 3**: In a gap between blocks → Scroll to previous block (shows what you just did)
- **Case 4**: During a block → Scroll to current block (existing behavior)

**User Experience:**
- Always oriented in time, even during gaps between blocks
- See what you just completed when in a gap
- Natural and intuitive scrolling behavior
- Works seamlessly with non-contiguous schedules

**Result:** The app keeps you oriented no matter where you are in your schedule!

### Version 1.5.1 (2025-01-13)
**🔧 DEBUG FEATURE: Test Notification Buttons**

**Debug Mode:**
- New toggle in Settings: "Debug Mode"
- When enabled, shows test buttons in each timeblock card
- Three test buttons per block:
  - **📅 Early Warning (30s)**: Test wrap-up notification with Complete/Skip buttons
  - **🔔 Block Start (30s)**: Test block start notification with Snooze/Open buttons
  - **✅ Block End (30s)**: Test block end notification with Complete/Skip buttons

**Fully Wired Testing:**
- Uses REAL notification system (Railway push server)
- Action buttons are fully functional
- Clicking "Complete" actually completes the block
- Clicking "Snooze" actually snoozes the block
- Perfect for testing Smart-Merge notification system

**Developer Experience:**
- Easy testing without waiting for real notifications
- Verify all three notification types work correctly
- Test action button functionality end-to-end

### Version 1.5.0 (2025-01-13)
**🧠 MAJOR UX IMPROVEMENT: Smart-Merge Notification System**

**ADHD-Optimized Notification Strategy:**
- **Contiguous blocks**: Smart-merge reduces cognitive load
  - Early warning (5-min before): "Wrap up: [Current Block]" + "Next: [Next Block] in 5 minutes"
  - Buttons: "✓ Complete" / "⏭ Skip" (for current block)
  - Block start: "Time for: [Next Block]" with "⏰ Snooze" / "Open App"
  - **Result**: Ask for completion during natural "winding down" phase, not at high-pressure "start now!" moment

- **Non-contiguous blocks** (with gaps): Full notification set
  - Block end: "How did it go?" with Complete/Skip buttons
  - Early warning: "Coming up: [Next Block] in 5 minutes"
  - Block start: "Time for: [Next Block]" with Snooze/Open

**Technical Implementation:**
- Smart detection of contiguous vs non-contiguous blocks
- Context-aware notification scheduling based on block relationships
- Automatic notification rescheduling when blocks are snoozed
- Support for flexible scheduling patterns (gaps between blocks)

**UX Benefits:**
- ✅ Reduces notification fatigue (no simultaneous notifications)
- ✅ Supports executive function instead of challenging it
- ✅ Contextual actions at the right moment
- ✅ Works with any scheduling pattern

**Inspired by UX research for ADHD users** - this is a defining feature of Time Diet!

### Version 1.4.0 (2025-01-13)
**🚀 MAJOR FEATURE: Interactive Notification Actions**

**Notification Action Buttons:**
- **Complete from notification**: Early warning notifications (5-min) have "✓ Complete" and "⏭ Skip" buttons
- **Snooze from notification**: Block start notifications have "⏰ Snooze 5min" and "Open App" buttons
- **Works on Android & Desktop**: Full support for notification action buttons
- **Background actions**: Complete or skip timeblocks without opening the app

**Technical Implementation:**

- Notification type detection (early-warning vs block-start)
- Block ID and date tracking in notification payload
- Automatic schedule updates from notification actions

**Result:** Manage your schedule directly from notifications - perfect for quick completions or snoozing blocks when you're busy!

### Version 1.2.1 (2025-01-03)
**🐛 Bug Fixes & Architecture Improvements**

- **New Day Detail Modal**: Double-tap calendar dates to view detailed statistics and time blocks for past/future days
- **Improved app architecture**: "Today" tab now always shows today only, with separate modal for historical review
- **Fixed SPA routing**: Added Vercel configuration to prevent 404 errors on page refresh

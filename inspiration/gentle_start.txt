A Gentler Start (Quick Mental Reset)

When you notice harsh self-judgment, replace it with: “I’m a person learning a new routine. Progress > perfection.”

If you slip, say: “Reset now.” No error autopsy; just resume.

14-Day Reset (Simple and Specific)

Goal: stable sleep, predictable focus blocks, YouTube/gaming under control.

1) Sleep Anchor (non-negotiable)

Pick a wake-up time and stick to it for 14 days (weekends included).
Example (Brazil time): Wake up 7:30 AM, lights out 11:30 PM.

Morning: natural light for 10–20 min within the first hour after waking; if possible, take a short walk.

Night: screens in warm/dark mode after 9:30 PM; avoid scrolling in bed.

If you can’t fall asleep: get up, keep lights low, read on paper; return to bed when sleepy.

2) Time Budget (your “diet”)

Think of your day as 100 points. Allocate them before the day begins:

Essentials (sleep, meals, hygiene): 30

Deep work/study (2–4 focus blocks): 40

Admin/chores/messages: 10

Leisure (YouTube/games/social): 20 (to be reduced later)

If you spend too many points early, leisure gets tighter later — just like a calorie budget.

3) YouTube & Games: Change the Environment, Not Willpower

Pick one option that feels doable and stick to it for 14 days.

Option A — Usage Window (highest success rate):

YouTube: only 7:30–8:30 PM, on TV or tablet (not phone/PC). No Shorts.

Games: Fri–Sun only, up to 2 h/day, starting after 4 PM.

Option B — Weekday Fast:

Mon–Thu: no YouTube/games.

Fri–Sun: up to 2 h/day total.

Blockers (set once and forget):

PC/Mac: Cold Turkey, Freedom, or Focus (strict mode; schedule as above).

Phone: iOS Screen Time / Android Digital Wellbeing — daily limit 0 on weekdays; allow only the TV app or YouTube domain during your window.

YouTube hygiene: sign out, unsubscribe from all but 5 “intentional” channels; hide Home feed (e.g., Unhook extension).

Substitutions (so it doesn’t feel like suffering):
When the 10-min urge hits →

step outside 3 min,

drink water + 10 push-ups or stretch,

set a 10-min timer and open your current task.
The craving almost always passes.

4) Workday Scaffolding (ADHD-friendly)

Use 2–4 focus blocks of 50 minutes with 10-minute breaks.

Start each block with a 20-second “commitment script”:
“For the next 50 minutes, I’m only doing X. Everything else waits.”

Keep a Parking Lot (notepad) beside you to dump random thoughts and keep going.

Break recipe: stand up, drink water, look into the distance, quick stretch; avoid phone.

5) Ritalin Highs & Lows

(Talk to your doctor about timing/dose; below are non-medical supports.)

Anticipate the dip: note roughly when it hits; schedule light tasks or a walk then.

Eat on time: good protein + carb combos at breakfast and lunch; don’t skip meals (dips get worse).

Caffeine: none after late morning; if used early, pair with water.

Physical reset: 5–10 min brisk walk or light mobility at the start of the dip.

6) Friction to Prevent Nighttime Slips

Store controllers/handhelds in another room by 9 PM.

Charge phone outside bedroom; use a cheap alarm clock.

Night checklist (paper on the door):
dishes → floss → tidy 5 min → clothes for tomorrow → lights off.

Tiny Tracking System (< 2 min)

At day’s end, mark:

Woke up 7:30? ✅/❌

Focus blocks done: 0/1/2/3/4

Leisure within rules? ✅/❌

Lights out 11:30? ✅/❌

If you get 3 or more checks, the day “counts.” Aim for 9 / 14.

Do You Need to Quit YouTube/Games Entirely?

Not necessarily. Most people do better with guilt-free leisure inside clear boundaries than with total abstinence. If the boundaries keep failing, take a 30-day full break, then re-introduce the window.

Tomorrow’s Script (Ready-Made)

Set alarm 7:30 AM; leave phone in kitchen.

Install a blocker (strict mode) and schedule your window.

Write three tasks for the first two focus blocks.

Store the controller; TV/YouTube allowed only 7:30–8:30 PM.

Night checklist at 10:45 PM; lights out 11:30 PM.

If You Slip

Say “Reset now,” walk 3 minutes, and start a new 25–50 min block. No self-insults; they don’t help.

If you want, I can turn this into a printable page or a tiny tracking sheet. And if Ritalin crashes stay strong or sleep remains irregular after 2–3 weeks, talk to your prescriber — timing/dose can be fine-tuned.

About Using a Kindle Instead of Paper (for Sleep)

Short answer: yes — an e-ink Kindle with very low, warm front light is an excellent paper substitute for insomnia moments.

How to make it sleep-friendly:

Prefer e-ink, not tablet. Paperwhite/Oasis/Scribe are front-lit (so light hits the screen, not your eyes) — much softer than LCD phones/iPads.

Brightness 1–3, temperature max warm — just enough to read.

Airplane mode on. No notifications, no store, just books.

Choose “low-adrenaline” content: re-reads, essays, nature — avoid addictive “one more chapter” plots.

Read outside the bed under dim light. CBT-I standard: get out of bed, read until sleepy, return to bed.

Limit time: set auto-off or timer for 20–30 min; if still awake, read a bit longer then try again.

Skip extras: no browser/X-Ray/Goodreads — they spike stimulation.

If you only have a phone or tablet, paper is better — or at least use dark mode, warm tone, minimum brightness, no apps. But with an e-ink Kindle set as above, you’re in very safe territory for sleep.
